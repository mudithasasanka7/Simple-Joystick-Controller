🤖 ESP32 Servo Motor Project

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of an ESP32 microcontroller to control a servo motor, making it rotate continuously in a loop. The project uses the ESP32Servo library for seamless operation, with the servo toggling its rotation direction every 3 seconds.

🌟 Features

Servo Motor Control: Rotate continuously in a loop.

Configurable Timing: Change rotation intervals easily.

Compact Setup: Minimal hardware requirements.
